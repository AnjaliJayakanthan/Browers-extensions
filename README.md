## Objective
To learn how to spot and remove potentially harmful browser extensions as part of improving browser security.

---

##  Steps Followed

1. **Opened Extension Manager**
   - Accessed `chrome://extensions` (Google Chrome) to view all installed extensions.

2. **Reviewed All Extensions**
   - Checked each extension to see if I recognized and used it.
   - Paid special attention to those I didn’t install myself or no longer needed.

3. **Checked Permissions**
   - Clicked on “Details” for each extension.
   - Looked for dangerous permissions like:
     - "Read and change all your data on the websites you visit"
     - "Access to clipboard" or "Read browsing history"

4. **Googled Suspicious Extensions**
   - Searched online for any unfamiliar names along with keywords like `malware`, `scam`, or `reviews`.

5. **Removed Unwanted Extensions**
   - Found and removed the following suspicious or unused extensions:
     - **Video Downloader Pro** – Unused and had excessive permissions.
     - **Super Search Tab** – Unknown source, risky permissions.
   - Kept only trusted and actively used extensions.

6. **Restarted the Browser**
   - Closed and reopened Chrome to make sure everything was updated.
